# Churn-predction-in-Telco
Client churn is a term used in the service business to describe when a customer decides to stop using a service by cancelling their subscription or refusing to pay for it. Churn is defined as the percentage of customers who stop utilizing a service after a specific amount of time.   But why is calculating the turnover rate so important? Is it going to hurt your business if you lose 5% of your customers? The answer is yes because acquiring new clients is more expensive than keeping existing customers. By retaining existing clients, a business can save money on the operating costs associated with acquiring new consumers. As a result, we'll apply advanced machine learning algorithms like Keras to forecast future churners and make efforts to prevent them from leaving a company's service. This project aims to create a deep learning model that will aid in forecasting customers who are likely to churn in the following N months and assisting in the implementation of business activities to reduce churn.
